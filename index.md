## About Me

I am a fourth-year PhD student in Operations Research at ISyE, Georgia Tech. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Guanghui (George) Lan](https://sites.gatech.edu/guanghui-lan/) and Prof. [Ashwin Pananjady](https://sites.gatech.edu/ashwin-pananjady/). I also obtained an M.S. in Quantitative and Computational Finance from the same institute. Before that, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Fudan University.



## Research Interests

My research focuses on the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for *Nonlinear Optimization*, *Stochastic Optimization*, and *Reinforcement Learning*. I am particularly interested in

- **Policy optimization and policy evaluation in reinforcement learning** 
- **Parameter-free methods for convex and nonconvex optimization** 
- **Stochastic optimization methods for statistical learning and machine learning**
- **Real-life applications:** healthcare, E-commerce, financial industry, etc
